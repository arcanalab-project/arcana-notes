Most AI tools today are optimized for conversation.

Arcana is not.

Arcana is an **agentic AI system** designed to reason about real-world data architectures, with a strong focus on MongoDB-based systems.

## The problem Arcana tries to solve

Modern systems are no longer just “an app plus a database”.

They are:
- distributed
- data-intensive
- AI-augmented
- continuously evolving

In these environments, architectural decisions around:
- data modeling
- sharding
- workload isolation
- multi-region design
- AI integration

do not have single correct answers.

They require reasoning, trade-offs, and context.

## Why Arcana is agentic by design

Arcana follows an agent-first approach:

- interactions start from **intent**, not chat history  
- documents and data are **inputs to reasoning**, not final answers  
- the agent accumulates context while exploring a problem space  
- outputs are structured to support decisions, not just explanations  

This makes Arcana closer to a **technical collaborator** than to a Q&A system.

## MongoDB as a knowledge substrate

MongoDB plays a central role in Arcana’s design.

It acts as:
- a system of record
- a document and metadata store
- a semantic retrieval layer
- an architectural boundary

This makes it a natural foundation for agentic systems that need to reason over both structured and unstructured knowledge.

## Not a shortcut generator

Arcana is not:
- a generic LLM wrapper
- a prompt playground
- a FAQ system

It does not replace engineering judgment.
It exists to support it.
